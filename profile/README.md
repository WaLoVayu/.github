## About us

We host several repositories containing resources used to provide working ARM64 Windows/Linux on the POCO X3 Pro

Most of the Windows stuff you will find here is based on work of [WOA Project](https://github.com/WOA-Project) and [Project Aloha](https://github.com/Project-Aloha)

Most of the Linux stuff you will find here is based on work of [SM8150-Mainlining](https://github.com/sm8150-mainlining)
